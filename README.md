# Ensemble Deep Learning Ransomware Detector
A Deep Learning ensemble that classifies Windows executable files as either benign, ransomware, or other malware.
This program was developed as part of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science dissertation: 'Ransomware Detection Using Deep Learning Ensemble' in which it is demonstrated to achieve 96% accuracy in classifying a test set of 3000 PE files not seen in the model's training.

A simple terminal program to classify files, as well as source code for the Keras models, pre-processing, and data mining, will be released shortly.
